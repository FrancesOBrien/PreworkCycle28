	<h3>Welcome to my first HTML webpage!</h3>
</body>
</div>
	<p>Originally from Northeast Ohio, I have lived in California, Oregon, and Washington before moving to Pittsburgh with my 
		family in March of 2020. My wife and I have two children; Albert, 3, and Maddalena, 5, and a Labrador named Teacake, 
		who is 4. I am excited to be a part of Cycle 28 and I am eager to learn and become a software engineer.</p>
	<h2>My Busy Summer</h2>
<div id="div2">
	<p id="para1">It has been a busy season for me and my family. In June, my family gathered to celebrate my dad's 70th
		birthday. We visited the trainyard where my sister's husband, Chris, works on engines. My son, Albert, got to climb 
		into the cupola on a caboose. In July, I made the decision to leave my longtime career at Whole Foods Market and focus
		on my own career development. We were able to drive to the Delaware Bay to see my cousins and their daughters, and rescue
		over forty horseshoe crabs stranded at low tide. In August, I turned my focus on projects around our house and built a 
		garden in our front yard. I also applied to Per Scholas and was accepted to the Software Engineer course, which happily
		coincided with my kids' return to school.</p>
	<h2>My Plan for Fall</h2>
	<p class="bluep">I am grateful to be a part of Per Scholas Cycle 28, and I look forward to the demands of the season. My 
		kids are old enough now to share a room somewhat harmoniously, which allowed for the creation of a small office for me 
		to work from, which in turn allowed for our dining room to function just as a dining room, instead of part office, part time 
		pre school, and part time dining area. It feels good to have a new direction for my career, and to have the opportunity to be 
		home for my kids on a more regular basis.</p>
